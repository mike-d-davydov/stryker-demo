Code sample for InRhythm Lightning Talk demo [Introduction into test design and test coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xnbQcFR1Tg&t=2s) on 30 Sep 2021.

This sample was used to demonstrate how traditional line code coverage is different from mutation code coverage, and how code with 100% unit test coverage can still have bugs (and how to find them).
